<h1>Trevor Stone &mdash; resume &#64; trevorstone.org<br>
<span class="contactinfo">303-EEL-WANG</span> &mdash; I am not currently seeking employment</h1>

<hr><h2>Mission Statement</h2>
My mission is to write software which <em>kicks ass</em>.  I want to work with
smart and creative people on projects which are worth doing right, help people
in creative ways, and improve the computer's role as a cognitive tool.  I am
especially interested in geography, artificial intelligence, human language,
cognitive science, and programming languages.

<h2>Computer Nerd</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Since my introduction to Logo and BASIC at age 10, I have
    relished wrapping my mind around formal language and precise
    instructions.  My professional coding experience lies mostly
    in Java and JavaScript. In my quest for the right balance between
    fluid English and mathematical formalism I've dabbled in many
    languages, with C, Ruby, Perl, Python, Go, and Lisp among those
    I've taken a liking to.
  <li>A distant descendant of <em>Homo habilis</em>, I adapt
    quickly to new environments and tools.  I swim comfortably in
    Linux and Mac environments. I pen code in Eclipse and vim.
    I speak standards like html, css, sql, and xml.
  <li>Since 2009 I've worked as a software engineer at Google, Inc.
    I work on Google Docs, helping millions of users organize, share,
    and enjoy their documents and files.  Using Java, JavaScript, and
    internal tools I have built new features, improved legacy code,
    monitored production services, and gathered statistics on usage.
  <li>From 2004 to 2009 I worked as a software engineer at Tyler
    Technologies, Inc. I worked at all levels of their Java-based
    enterprise applications. I explored and questioned requirements
    with analysts, built Swing-based GUIs, designed core services,
    refactored key data structures, debugged the persistence layer,
    led complex module development, crafted a data conversion
    specification, and reviewed almost every commit. I created a
    system to extract named entities from OCR text. I developed the
    architecture and user interface to work with GIS data. I stood
    out as a "go-to-guy" for insight about everything from subsystem
    design to text processing.
  <li>At UNAVCO, Inc. in 2003 I used Perl and JavaScript to create
    educational Earth science map tools.
  <li>In December, 2003 I graduated from the University of Colorado,
    Boulder.  I received both a Bachelor of Science With Distinction
    and a Master of Science in Computer Science.  My GPA was 3.8
    on a 4.0 scale.
  <li>I pursued advanced coursework in object oriented design,
    algorithms, programming languages, operating systems, network
    systems, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, machine
    learning, speech recognition, natural language processing, user
    interface design, network systems, and Unix system administration.
</ul>

<h2>Eclectic Philosopher</h2>
<ul>
  <li>At CU, I minored in philosophy and was president of the
    Philosophy Club.  I love to explore life's deep questions.  I
    use analytic and holistic techniques to explore ethics, society,
    identity, and metaphysics.  I presented a paper on weakness of
    will at the 2002 Rocky Mountain Student Philosophy Conference.
  <li>During high school I taught a Socratic seminar course on
    world philosophy.
  <li>My world view ties computer science to philosophy and
    psychology.  I am fascinated by artificial intelligence, cognitive
    science, linguistics, limits of formal systems, self-organization,
    and societal use of computers.
</ul>

<h2>Generally Diverse Individual</h2>
<ul>
  <li>My calm personality, helpful demeanor, mediation and problem
    solving skills, and concern for public safety led me to positions
    as a resident advisor at CU and a Black Rock Ranger at Burning Man.
  <li>In college, I developed leadership skills as chapter vice
    president of Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society,
    and as organizer of Pagan and Green Party student groups.
  <li>I am a friendly and unique individual.  While I take projects
    and tasks seriously, a subtle wit and creative approach to the
    mundane pervade my actions, keeping a smile present among my
    fellows. My extensive knowledge of geographic, historic, and
    scientific facts entertains coworkers during casual moments.
  <li>I love language.  I play with English idioms, speak passable
    Spanish, and dabble in Chinese.
  <li>I connect with the world around me through photography,
    camping, bicycling, and playing games.
</ul>
