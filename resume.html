<h1>Trevor Stone &mdash; resume &#64; trevorstone.org<br />
  <span class="subhead">Boulder, Colorado &mdash; I am not currently seeking employment</span>
</h1>

<hr><h2>Mission Statement</h2>
My mission is to write software which helps humanity. I want to work with smart
and creative people on projects which are worth doing right, solve important
problems, and improve the computerâ€™s role as a cognitive tool. I am especially
interested in geography, human language, cognitive science, user interfaces, and
data accessibility.

<h2>Computer Nerd</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Since my introduction to Logo and BASIC at age 10, I have relished
    wrapping my mind around formal language and precise instructions.  My
    professional coding experience lies mostly in Java and JavaScript. In my
    quest for the right balance between fluid English and mathematical formalism
    I&rsquo;ve used Ruby, Python, Perl, C, bash, and PHP and dabbled in many
    others from Go to Lisp to Julia to TypeScript.</li>
  <li>I help teams and individuals grow.  I&rsquo;ve conducted over 200 technical
    interviews and sit on a hiring committee.  I am a thorough code reviewer
    and have provided feedback on hundreds of design documents.</li>
  <li>Since 2009 I&rsquo;ve worked as a staff software engineer at Google.  I work
    on Google Drive, helping hundreds of millions of users organize, share, and
    enjoy their files.  I helped build the Drive UI, Drive Viewer and video
    playback, data analysis pipelines, and server infrastructure.  I built a
    database for understanding product usage and educated stakeholders on
    querying it.  I have served on 24/7 on call rotations to ensure availability
    and reliability of Drive and I work to reduce the operational load of
    services.  I led a major migration and deletion effort of a critical legacy
    system serving tens of thousands of user requests per second.</li>
  <li>From 2004 to 2009 I worked as a software engineer at Tyler Technologies,
    building enterprise applications for county government offices.  I explored
    requirements with analysts, built GUIs, designed core
    services, led complex module development, and crafted a data conversion
    specification.  I created a system to
    extract named entities from OCR text.  I developed the architecture and user
    interface to work with GIS data.</li>
  <li>At UNAVCO in 2003 I used Perl and JavaScript to create educational
    Earth science map tools.</li>
  <li>In December 2003 I graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder.
    I received both a Bachelor of Science With Distinction and a Master of
    Science in Computer Science.  My GPA was 3.8 on a 4.0 scale.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eclectic Philosopher</h2>
<ul>
  <li>At CU, I minored in philosophy and was president of the Philosophy Club.
    I love to explore life&rsquo;s deep questions.  I use analytic and holistic
    techniques to explore ethics, society, identity, and metaphysics.
    I presented a paper on weakness of will at the 2002 Rocky Mountain Student
    Philosophy Conference.</li>
  <li>During high school I taught a Socratic seminar course on world
    philosophy.</li>
  <li>My world view ties computer science to philosophy and psychology.  I am
    fascinated by artificial intelligence, cognitive science, linguistics,
    limits of formal systems, self-organization, and societal use of computers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Generally Diverse Individual</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I literally and figuratively wear many hats in organizations,
    providing insight and effort wherever needed.</li>
  <li>At Burning Man I volunteer as a Black Rock Ranger,
    practicing compassionate peer counseling, non-confrontational community
    mediation, and incident management in a diverse and dynamic temporary city.</li>
  <li>In college I developed leadership skills as a resident advisor; as
    chapter vice president of Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor
    society; and as organizer of spiritual and political student groups.</li>
  <li>I volunteer with Citizens&rsquo; Climate Lobby to build broad political
    support for climate change solutions.</li>
  <li>I am a friendly and unique individual.  While I take projects and tasks
    seriously, a subtle wit and creative approach to the mundane pervade my
    actions, keeping a smile present among my fellows. My extensive knowledge of
    geographic, historic, and scientific facts entertains coworkers during
    casual moments.</li>
  <li>I love language.  I play with English idioms, speak passable Spanish,
    and dabble in Chinese.</li>
  <li>I connect with the world around me through photography, homebrew, camping,
    bicycling, and playing games.</li>
</ul>
