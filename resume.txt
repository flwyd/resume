Mission Statement

   My mission is to write software which kicks ass. I want to work
   with smart and creative people on projects which are worth doing
   right, help people in creative ways, and improve the computer's
   role as a cognitive tool.  I am especially interested in geography,
   artificial intelligence, human language, cognitive science, and
   programming languages.

Computer Nerd

 * Since my introduction to Logo and BASIC at age 10, I have relished
   wrapping my mind around formal language and precise instructions.
   My professional coding experience lies mostly in Java and JavaScript.
   In my quest for the right balance between fluid English and
   mathematical formalism I've dabbled in many languages, with C,
   Ruby, Perl, Python, Go, and Lisp among those I've taken a liking to.
 * A distant descendant of Homo habilis, I adapt quickly to new
   environments and tools. I swim comfortably in Linux and Mac
   environments.  I pen code in Eclipse and vim. I speak standards like
   html, css, sql, and xml.
 * From 2004 to 2009 I worked as a software engineer at Tyler               
   Technologies, Inc. I worked at all levels of their Java-based            
   enterprise applications. I explored and questioned requirements with     
   analysts, built Swing-based GUIs, designed core services, refactored     
   key data structures, debugged the persistence layer, led complex         
   module development, crafted a data conversion specification, and         
   reviewed almost every commit. I created a system to extract named        
   entities from OCR text. I developed the architecture and user  
   interface to work with GIS data. I stood out as a "go-to-guy" for        
   insight about everything from subsystem design to text processing.       
 * At UNAVCO, Inc. in 2003 I used Perl and JavaScript to create
   educational Earth science map tools.
 * In December, 2003 I graduated from the University of Colorado,
   Boulder. I received both a Bachelor of Science With Distinction
   and a Master of Science in Computer Science. My GPA was 3.8 on a
   4.0 scale.
 * I pursued advanced coursework in object oriented design, algorithms,
   programming languages, operating systems, network systems, cognitive
   science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, speech
   recognition, natural language processing, user interface design,
   network systems, and Unix system administration.

Eclectic Philosopher

 * At CU, I minored in philosophy and was president of the Philosophy
   Club. I love to explore life's deep questions. I use analytic and
   holistic techniques to explore ethics, society, identity, and
   metaphysics. I presented a paper on weakness of will at the 2002
   Rocky Mountain Student Philosophy Conference.
 * During high school I taught a Socratic seminar course on world philosophy.
 * My world view ties computer science to philosophy and psychology.
   I am fascinated by artificial intelligence, cognitive science,
   linguistics, limits of formal systems, self-organization, and
   societal use of computers.

Generally Diverse Individual

 * My calm personality, helpful demeanor, mediation and problem
   solving skills, and concern for public safety led me to positions
   as a resident advisor at CU and a Black Rock Ranger at Burning Man.
 * In college, I developed leadership skills as chapter vice president
   of Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society, and as
   organizer of Pagan and Green Party student groups.
 * I am a friendly and unique individual. While I take projects and
   tasks seriously, a subtle wit and creative approach to the mundane
   pervade my actions, keeping a smile present among my fellows. My
   extensive knowledge of geographic, historic, and scientific facts
   entertains coworkers during casual moments.
 * I love language. I play with English idioms, speak passable
   Spanish, and dabble in Chinese.
 * I connect with the world around me through photography, camping,
   bicycling, and playing games.
